#Challenges and Issues

We are still running into some scheduling issues, impacted by the timezone difference with our sponsors.
Additionally, we have experienced technical difficulties with holding meetings over Google Hangouts,
which has wasted time and made communicating requirements more tedious.

Defining meaningful business objectives has also proved difficult for both our team,
because we don't have a solid understanding of how to effectively measure what our project's primary goal is.
