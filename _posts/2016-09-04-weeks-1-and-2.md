# Status Report for Weeks 1 & 2

The past two weeks were mainly spent forming our team and establishing our project sponsor and idea.

We will be developing a mobile photo application designed to be standalone or integrable with another companyâ€™s application. The application will allow users to take photos and impose themed frames around them and share them through various social media channels. Example frames are seasonal (spring/summer break), life events (getting married), sponsored frames (company branding/product), location based, and more.

The application will have a data analytics component. Both native data analysis and integration with other data collection/analyzation tools such as Social Rank is required. The goal is to provide this information to sponsors/companies using this application to show success/failure of the app and overall branding campaign.

## What We Did

We met three times this week to discuss our potential sponsors and project ideas, and then we created questions for the sponsor about the project pitch we were given.

## Challenges or Issues

We may have issues finding a suitable meeting time with each other and our project sponsor, since our project sponsor lives in California.

Until further inspection and requirements analysis, the architecture for our application may not be sufficiently difficult.
